# ImageKernelFilter
Explore different 2D filter kernel and their implementation method in FPGA
This project requires Quartus II 15.0.2 software and its associated modelsim software
Run the .tcl file on quartus tcl console to create the project. 
After the project file is created, open the project with quartus II 15.0.2 and run compilation. After that you can run the simulation
It has one default image file (.hex) format for simulation. You can add your image file (.hex) to run the simulation. Depends on the row and column of the image, some parameter of the test bench may need to be modified accordingly.
